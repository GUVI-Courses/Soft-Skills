Case Study 2: Riya’s Journey into the Marketing Industry
Riya is a recent graduate with a degree in Marketing and Communications. She dreams of securing a job in the marketing industry but struggles to get interviews. She has applied to over 100 jobs using the same generic resume and cover letter but hasn't received any responses. Her LinkedIn profile is incomplete, and she rarely engages in networking or industry discussions.
One day, Riya attends a marketing conference and connects with a hiring manager from a leading advertising firm. The manager advises her to gain hands-on experience through internships, showcase her skills with a portfolio (such as case studies or social media campaigns), and refine her resume to highlight relevant achievements.
Taking this advice seriously, Riya customizes her resume for each job application, updates her LinkedIn profile with her skills and projects, and begins networking with marketing professionals. She also started a blog to share her insights on digital marketing trends. Within a month, she starts receiving interview calls and eventually lands an internship that leads to a full-time job offer.
